Value investing analysis
========================

Investing is an important part in one's life. With a proper investing, one would have a retired life free from worrying money. Nowadays, most investing is done by financial institutes. However, many financial institutes charge a good amount of managing fee but have under average performance. Can we invest stocks by ourselves? Yes, we can but it can be very risky. One relatively less risky investing method is called value investing. It has been a hot topic in the stock market for decades. In particular, the success of Warren Buffett inspired many people to pursue this approach.

In this report, I did a qantative analysis on the historical stock data to test the value investing method. Stock data were downloaded from [stockrow.com](stockrow.com) and [Yahoo finance](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com).

The six fundemental Buffett's methodologies can be found [here](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp):

1.  Has the company consistently performed well? (Return on Equity (ROE))
2.  Has the company avoided excess debt?
3.  Are profit margins high? Are they increasing?
4.  How long has the company been public?
5.  Is the stock selling at a 25% discount to its real value?
6.  Do the company's products rely on a commodity?

The first five rules can be quantified using historical data. The sixth rule require expertise in finance, so will not be considered here.

### Analysis

In this analysis, only stocks in US stock exchanges and have market capital larger than ten billion US dollars are considered. For small market cap stocks, parameters fluctuate a lot, and hence value investing may not apply well in general.

I will use some criteria based on the first four rules to classify stocks into two or more groups. For example, the revenue growth rate is larger than 5%. After classification, we can visualize the stock average price growth verse the groups. We can also try to optimize the criteria so that we can separate a group from the other, which gives the maximum returns in stock growth. These visualization and analysis will conducted in next two milestones and results will be summarized in the final report.
