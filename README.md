# Value Investment Analysis
Value investing has been a hot topic in stock market. In particular, the success of Warren Buffett inspired many people to pursue the value investing approach. In this project, I would like to test value investing method using ten years historical stock data.

The six known Buffett's methodologies can found [here](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp):

1. Has the company consistently performed well?
2. Has the company avoided excess debt?
3. Are profit margins high? Are they increasing?
4. How long has the company been public?
5. Do the company's products rely on a commodity?
6. Is the stock selling at a 25% discount to its real value?

 The first four rules can quantified using historical stock data. The other two rules require expertise in finance, so will not be considered here.

 __The null hypothesis__ (need to be refined as the project evolving): The trun means of returns are the same for two groups that classified by the first four rules.
